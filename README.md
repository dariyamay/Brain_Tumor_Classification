Brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells inside the skull. A malignant brain tumour is a fast-growing cancer that spreads to other areas of the brain and spine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a popular method for detecting brain tumors. The improvement of machine and deep learning techniques can help doctors in tumor diagnostics without invasive measures. Moreover, a manual examination can be error-prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties. One of the deep learning algorithms that has achieved substantial results in image segmentation and classification is the convolutional neural network (CNN). In this project we focused on three tumor types: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary and classify them using CNN model. Learning eventually obtained accuracy of 0.9779 and 0.9305 for training and testing, respectively.
It could be interpreted as a good results despite slight overfitting.
